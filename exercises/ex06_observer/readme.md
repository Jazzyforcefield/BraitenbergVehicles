### Observer Pattern implementation from Head First Design Patterns

You have a weather station that periodically updates its weather. There is a database to keep a historical account of weather and there is a viewer for displaying real-time updates of the current weather.

To get this working, you will need to complete:
- main.cc
- methods for the database
- methods for the viewer
- implement a mechanism for removing an observer
